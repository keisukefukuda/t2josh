Introduction
------------

t2josh is a job submission helper script for TSUBAME 2.0.
To submit a job on TSUBAME2.0, you have to (1) prepare a job script which includes
environmental variable settings, and (2) call 't2sub' command with correct arguments,
such as #node/#procs/#cups.

't2josh' does these chores for you, which include

 - preparing a shell script to be executed by t2sub
 - calculate # of processes/nodes/ncpus and set OpneMP evn vars
 - detect compilation environment(compiler and MPI library choice)

You can see what generated shell scripts and commands look like by using --dry option, which means 'dry run'.

Examples
--------

Let's see some examples:

### Example: Invoke a serial program

    $ t2josh -g t2g-yourgroup --dry -- ./a.out -n 1 2 3

produces the below

<% t2josh -g t2g-yourgroup --dry -- ./a.out -n 1 2 3 %>


You can see the generated shell script and command line.

Text between "#----" lines is content of the generated temporary shell script,
which includes generated t2sub command line as a comment.

'--' is used to separate arguments for t2josh and program to be executed
with its arguments. You can also write like
     $ t2josh -g t2g-yourgroup --dry "./a.out -n 1 2 3"
without "--". Since we used --dry option here, nothing is executed and we can observed
what t2josh command was trying to do.

"-g" option is used to specify your TSUBAME group. There is a warning
that no such group as 't2g-yourgroup', which we used as a dummy group name.

S queue is used by default. You can change queue by using -q option.


### Example: Invoke an MPI program on 4 nodes, with 8 processes per node.

     $ t2josh -n 8x4 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out

produces:

<% t2josh -n 8x4 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out %>

### Example: Invoke non-MPI OpenMP program

     $ t2josh --openmp=4 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out

produces:

<% t2josh --openmp=4 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out %>

NOTE: -n options implies MPI, so if you want to run a non-MPI OpenMP program, you have to use '--openmp=N'.

### Example: an MPI & OpenMP hybrid program

     $ t2josh -n 4x4x2 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out

produces:

<% t2josh -n 4x4x2 -g t2g-yourgroup -q S --dry ./a.out %>
